I split my Routing Analysis based on registry region so that the 
constituents of each region know what is going on in their area.

As you know registries offer training if their membership ask for it. 
APNIC and RIPE NCC membership seem to ask for training other than just 
how to be an LIR.

But how to be an LIR doesn't cover every single ASN who is announcing 
address space. For example, APNIC has an extensive region wide 
programme, but there is still large deaggregation here in the AP region...

So I really don't see what RIR training has to do with this. It helps, 
but it isn't the complete solution. If the industry is worried, the 
industry has to do something about it.

Duh!  No suprise there.  ARIN just gives IP space and only offers some
measly online training:

RIPE on the other hand, has 3-6 course a month, throughout Europe:
http://www.ripe.net/training/lir/index.html
http://www.ripe.net/cgi-bin/courselist.pl.cgi

APNIC also has a number of courses and goes out to where it is needed:

As long as ARIN just doles out IP space with no education, the routing
table will continue to grow.

Most seem to come from AS4323. Today they are announcing 2606 prefixes,
a week ago they were announcing 844 prefixes.
