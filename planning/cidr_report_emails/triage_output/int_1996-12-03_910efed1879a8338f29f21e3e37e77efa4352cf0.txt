In article &lt;199612020252.AA02201@zephyr.isi.edu&gt; you write:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; There is no &quot;absolute&quot; point at which to take these measurements. Any
&gt;&gt; point will be coloured (colored) by its relative Internet location with respect to
&gt;&gt; amounts of local detail and aggregated distant detail.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks,

&gt;
&gt;	True enough.. (coloured is the correct spelling :)
&gt;	Dave Meyers is starting to put up something like this
&gt;	off his exchange in oregon.
&gt;
&gt;	Perhaps it would be useful to get a number of players 
&gt;	together and ensure that we are taking routing snaps at
&gt;	the same time and then persuade JQ to revamp his &quot;Internet
&gt;	Weather Maps&quot; to reflect these high/low pressure patterns
&gt;	across the landscape.

Something like that is on the TODO list for the MIDS IWR, pending funding.

Thanks,
John
