Yeah maybe but what about where the RIRs have assigned independent /24 space..  
or ISPs have subdelegated the IPs to a multihomed customer, was more thinking
about where a bunch of routes originating from a single ASN can be aggregated 
rather than routing bloat in general. There are numerous such examples of people 
with eg a /19 announcing 32x /24 etc

So how do you deal with one but not with the other?
