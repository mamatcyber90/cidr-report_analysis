&gt; None of these are big enough to justify their own backbone operations or to
&gt; buy a backbone from someone else, or there wouldn't be a problem. Paying scads 
&gt; of extortion money is also problematic (cheaper to simply burn the IP addresses).
&gt;
&gt; I am NOT advocating tossing all of that out. I am simply bringing up a
&gt; problem condition. Please, don't shoot the messenger, or otherwise get
&gt; defensive (return fire is a bitch).

Nope, all of these are reasonable, the ones that aren't are, for example, 
where folks have a single connection, or multi-home only to a single provider.

 
&gt; What I am bringing up here is that new, information-age companies, 
&gt; as predicted in MegaTrends over 10 years ago, are now starting to
&gt; appear. They are very diffused (sparse population, over very large 
&gt; areas of the globe) and have connectivity needs which are both critical, 
&gt; yet very different from click-n-morter customers that the Big8 was 
&gt; built up to handle (either classful or classless). The current architecture
&gt; is not handeling them very well.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is currently in it's infancy, it will get much worse.

I'm not disagreeing with any of this.  Actually, I see reliability and 
availability feeding into all these other issues as well.

It just that some of the folks advocating portability and deaggregation are 
using &quot;route table size doesn't matter anymore&quot; as an argument, when it 
absolutely does matter, especially if we plan to make the Internet more 
reliable, and less vulnerable.
