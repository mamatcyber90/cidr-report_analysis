&gt;  From my own Routing Report (due out in a couple of hours), a quick

Duh!  No suprise there.  ARIN just gives IP space and only offers some
measly online training:

RIPE on the other hand, has 3-6 course a month, throughout Europe:

APNIC also has a number of courses and goes out to where it is needed:

As long as ARIN just doles out IP space with no education, the routing
table will continue to grow.

&gt; Most seem to come from AS4323. Today they are announcing 2606 prefixes,
&gt; a week ago they were announcing 844 prefixes.
