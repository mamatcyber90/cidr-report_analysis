&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [...]   - would you agree that most of the poor deaggregating is not
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intentional
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ie that they're announcing their '16 class Cs' or historically had 2
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; /21s and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Think about someone putting in a Null0 route and re-
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; exporting stuff unconditionally, now after he originates
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; his /19 he is then adding a /24 here, and a /25 there.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Lack of experience, when you suggest to them they should
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; remove these announcements they are afraid to change it,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; not understanding the implications, etc.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Not to mention ppl using cisco and prefix lists, it is
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; way too easy with cisco to say '/19 le 24', and then they
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; use outbound prefix lists to their transit supplier
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (different, but related as I see it). Some transit ISPs
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; use that a lot, and encourage the table growth.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; There are some business reasons to de-aggregate. Look at some outages
&gt; &gt;&gt; caused by 'routing problems' (someone leaked my /24's to their peers,
&gt; &gt;&gt; peers, peer and my traffic got blackholed, because the public net only
&gt; &gt;&gt; knows me as a /20)
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; There are multiple reasons for deaggregation aside from 'dumb
&gt; &gt;&gt; operator',
&gt; &gt;&gt; some are even 'valid' if you look at them from the protection
&gt; &gt;&gt; standpoint.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; -Chris
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That and the &quot;I have 1 circuit to $good_provider and 1 circuit to
&gt; &gt; $bad_provider and the only way I can make them balance is to split my
&gt; &gt; space in half and announce more specifics out through each provider&quot;
&gt; &gt; argument. I have also often seen people do this without announcing the
&gt; &gt; aggregate because   &lt;some undefined bad thing&gt; will happen, usually
&gt; &gt; justified with much hand-waving.  The people who do this can usually
&gt; &gt; not be reasoned with....
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It happens all the time...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Warren.
&gt; 
&gt; So, say  I'm a provider that has received a /22 from UUNet (just for example
&gt; Chris :-) ) and I now get another transit provider and announce the /22
&gt; there.  So, I call UUNet and ask them to announce the /22 as a more specific
&gt; because I don't want a de-facto asymmetric configuration.  I *want* to get a
&gt; /20 from ARIN but my usage doesn't justify it yet, so I have to ride the /22
&gt; for some time.

Hi Mike,
 this isnt the scenario being discussed. The scenario of issue is where you get 
your /22 from UUNET and announce 4x /24 ie based on what ips you have you choose 
to announce more than the minimum to make them routable

&gt; By the long string of anecdotal attacks in the string to date, listing most or
&gt; all such providers as &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;uninformed&quot; how do you separate out those
&gt; providers who are legitimately interested in routing redundancy and not clue
&gt; impaired?  Do we just say &quot;too bad, routing table bloat is more important than
&gt; your need for redundancy small guy!&quot;?

As I say this isnt the issue here, altho what you suggest would be an example
of further aggregation that i personally think is extreme. Multihoming must be 
possible and a hierarchical structure to the internet is not appropriate.

&gt; I find it interesting that the general theme is one of &quot;we're smarter than
&gt; they are because we aggregate more routes&quot; as if clue were directly correlated
&gt; to aggregated routing announcements.

Well, there does seem to be some loose correlation it cant be denied... (counter 
examples not required, we know they exist)
