Is aggregation being covered in the Sunday BoF's?

[ hint, hint ]


The BGP tutorials I've been doing on Sundays at NANOG all cover 
aggregation - at least, I seem to end up talking about aggregation in 
each one. Maybe I need to be more direct? But then again, who am I 
preaching to? The choir maybe, I don't know. Maybe we need a specific 
aggregation tutorial for those who don't know how to? Those who have 
operational and technical reasons not to aggregate have made that 
decision with prior knowledge. We should try and give everyone else the 
knowledge, then at least we will know that all de-aggregation is done 
for a reason.

Then it begs the question, is NANOG the conference actually reaching the 
people who'd most benefit from it? I say this as I'm in transit in 
Singapore heading back from a hugely successful and enjoyable SANOG 
(South Asia NOG) in Bangladesh. Similar idea to NANOG, but heavier 
emphasis on education (workshops &amp; tutorials), and we had ISPs falling 
over themselves to participate in the first Internet operations meeting 
held in that country.
