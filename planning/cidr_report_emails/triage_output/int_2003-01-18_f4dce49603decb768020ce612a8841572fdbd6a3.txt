   AS690 was originally aquired by Merit for the NSFNET T3 network
and subsequently assumed by ANS --&gt;  AOL --&gt;  UUNET --&gt; WorldCom
(I'm not entirely sure if this ordering is correct).
I've nagged Lee Howard a couple times to get this transferred
over.  Perhaps I need to go through a less busy person.

Well, here is an email I sent last month that didn't result in a single 
response - either human or auto-response:

Subject: Global routing table bloat - AS690
Cc: &quot;Barry Raveendran Greene&quot; &lt;bgreene@cisco.com&gt;, pfs@cisco.com

AS690 has been lately seen to be sending out too many prefixes not based 
on CIDR boundries, thereby increasing the global router table size:

ASnum    NetsNow NetsCIDR  NetGain  % Gain   Description
AS690    513     319       194       37.8%   MERIT-AS-27 Merit Network Inc.

See http://www.mcvax.org/~jhma/routing/ and http://bgp.potaroo.net/cidr/ 
and http://bgp.potaroo.net/cgi-bin/as-report?as=AS690&amp;view=4637
for further details.

I hope you can take the time to add the appropriate BGP filters so that 
the we all do not suffer from global router table bloat.

Thanks,
Hank
