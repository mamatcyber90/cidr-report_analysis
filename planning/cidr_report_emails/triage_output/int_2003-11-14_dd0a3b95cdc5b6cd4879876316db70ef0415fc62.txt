So who's job is it to clean this up - I dont think proxy aggregation is a good 
idea as someone suggested, the only people in a position to fix this are the ISP 
themselves, their upstreams and their peers.

Thank you for making my point for me.

Nobody - other than the people actually announcing the routes (and their 
upstreams and peers) can resolve this problem.

So self discipline is the only solution - and that looks like it isn't 
going to happen anytime soon.
