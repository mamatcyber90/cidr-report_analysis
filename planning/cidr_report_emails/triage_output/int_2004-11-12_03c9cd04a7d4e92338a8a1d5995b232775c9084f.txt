geoff,

your proggy already knows what filter list(s) would keep us
from carrying the polluters' rubbish.  any chance you could
generate the filter code for juniper, procket, and cisco so
automated router builds could fetch it with batch wget or ncftp
or whatever?

another cutie would be if whovever is maintaining peval this
week could add an option to not deliver covered prefixes from
the same origin?

no slur intended on any particular polluter.  but i think what
we have here is the strafing of the commons.  enough is enough.
