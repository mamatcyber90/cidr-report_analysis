&gt; Tony, I suspect that you and your weekly report are, in a large part,
&gt; responsible for this.  I thank you.  Our routers thank you.

Yeah, me, too!  Comparing with nearly 2 months ago pasted in above, this
is a fantastic trend!  Down 1700 routes (except sometimes).


&gt; Frank, if you're out there, has the curve changed since Tony started
&gt; publishing again?
&gt;
One of the things that I'm curious about: have any of the &quot;interesting
aggregates&quot; been acted upon?  The list seems to be getting _more_
entries, instead of the fewer I'd expect.  Perhaps I don't understand
the algorithm.

I find it hard to compare and check by eye.  By simple diff, I can see
that ANS and UUNET have been fixing them, since they've mostly
disappeared from the list.  But others seem to pop in and out, and
sometimes spawn many where there was only one line before, particularly
AGIS, MSEN, PREPnet and PSInet, all of whom should know better.

Could that be automatically added to the weekly summary?  &quot;Recent
aggregations&quot;, just before Interesting?   A tally of successes that
would be more clear than withdrawn route counts....

But folks _are_ withdrawing routes by the hundreds!
