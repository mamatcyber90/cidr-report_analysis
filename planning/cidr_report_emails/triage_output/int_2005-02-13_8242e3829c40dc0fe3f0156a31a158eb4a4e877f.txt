Nothing is going to happen unless enough people (ASNs) take a simultaneous, 
and  UNITED stand, and make it painful for those that don't care about the 
routes they leak to the net.

Similarly, &quot;enough people&quot; won't get involved until there is real financial
incentive to do so.  Most people won't particularly care about the number of
routes in a full table until their equipment becomes unable to handle it.

Does anyone have any idea of the routing table size limits of old but still
common equipment?  I suspect we'll see a lot more interest in routing table
size when things start to break.
