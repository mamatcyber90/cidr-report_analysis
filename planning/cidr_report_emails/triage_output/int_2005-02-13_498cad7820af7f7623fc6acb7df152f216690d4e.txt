[...]   - would you agree that most of the poor deaggregating is not 
intentional
ie that they're announcing their '16 class Cs' or historically had 2 
/21s and

Think about someone putting in a Null0 route and re-
exporting stuff unconditionally, now after he originates
his /19 he is then adding a /24 here, and a /25 there.
Lack of experience, when you suggest to them they should
remove these announcements they are afraid to change it,
not understanding the implications, etc.

Not to mention ppl using cisco and prefix lists, it is
way too easy with cisco to say '/19 le 24', and then they
use outbound prefix lists to their transit supplier
(different, but related as I see it). Some transit ISPs
use that a lot, and encourage the table growth.


There are some business reasons to de-aggregate. Look at some outages
caused by 'routing problems' (someone leaked my /24's to their peers,
peers, peer and my traffic got blackholed, because the public net only
knows me as a /20)

There are multiple reasons for deaggregation aside from 'dumb 
operator',
some are even 'valid' if you look at them from the protection 
standpoint.

That and the &quot;I have 1 circuit to $good_provider and 1 circuit to 
$bad_provider and the only way I can make them balance is to split my 
space in half and announce more specifics out through each provider&quot;  
argument. I have also often seen people do this without announcing the 
aggregate because   &lt;some undefined bad thing&gt; will happen, usually 
justified with much hand-waving.  The people who do this can usually 
not be reasoned with....

It happens all the time...

Warren.
