are these numbers what i think, but hope not, they are?

e.g. is AS18566 the origin AS for 751 prefixes that could be
collapsed to 6?


yup - see http://www.cidr-report.org/cgi-bin/as-report?as=AS18566&amp;view=4637



if not, then perhaps the report could use some work.


I'm more than happy to do further work on this report to improve its 
accuracy and helpfulness to the operator community, but in this case I'm 
not sure what such work would be, as I believe that the report is accurate 
about the potential level of prefix removal at a global BGP level.
