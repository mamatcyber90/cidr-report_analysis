&gt; &gt; &gt; ~ +3000 routes in one week? Anyone else frightened by this?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Florian
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; any thoughts on how to fix it? my peers keep sending these to me and i'll
&gt; &gt; even admit my customers do too. telling people its bad doesnt appear to have
&gt; &gt; an effect, at the small end networks seem to collect /24s and announce them
&gt; &gt; freely, at the large end i'm still without an explanation as to why large
&gt; &gt; networks require so many prefixes - none of them seem to comment?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; if people arent self policing it seems the only other way is for the larger
&gt; &gt; transit providers to stop accepting prefixes and telling their customers to
&gt; &gt; fix their s**t. and i dont see them doing this.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me they get paid to carry prefixes by their customers.

the payment would be the same if it was a /19 or 32x/24 announced at source

&gt; And their peers listen to the prefixes because they make money by using
&gt; those prefixes.
&gt; 
&gt; So, to the extent you make money listening to them, use the routes.

so the problem is noone wants to be the first to jump as it costs money? so 
whats the suggestion for how to not be first? ie is it possible for a small 
group of large operators to agree a consensus? 

you dont even have to actively filter to start this, if a script were run to 
advise customers daily when they were announcing routes incompliant to the 
transits 'routing policy' it would have some effect. one thing i've found from 
some of my customers is they're actually ignorant to the problems they cause, 
they think its cool to announce 10 prefixes and can be educated otherwise.

&gt; 
&gt; And if they start to cause you problems you will have to take corrective
&gt; action to stablize your network, as was done a long time ago (internet
&gt; time):

&gt; 
&gt; (link grabbed at random from the archives, I'm sure there are better posts
&gt; that actually list the full old school sprint filters.)
&gt; 
&gt; However, if you are the one filtering and all your competitors figure out
&gt; how to handle 154,000 routes then you will be at a competitive
&gt; disadvantage.
&gt; 
&gt; Coincidentally, the largest networks also spend the most with their
&gt; vendors and get to tell the vendors what they want in the next generation
&gt; of boxes they buy.
