&gt; also often seen people do this without announcing the aggregate because &lt;some
&gt; undefined bad thing&gt; will happen, usually justified with much hand-waving.  
&gt; The people who do this can usually not be reasoned with....

this just reinforces the argument that they are lacking in technical savvy. 

i have a transit provider who i dont want to carry much traffic and i dont want
to prepend my announcements.. by looking at that providers supported customer
communities i just get them to prepend as they export to other major networks
thus moving the main volume of the traffic to the desired ingress paths

no deaggregation, no prepending..
