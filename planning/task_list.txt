0. Determine sampling frequency for CIDR Report
    - once/week (Friday afternoon -- perhaps generated from Friday Midnight routing table?) since October 1996
        - **need to collect these from http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/nanog**
        - starting date -- Friday, November 14, 1997

0. Determine file formats involved over the archive time period
    - `MRT_TABLE_DUMP_V2` since ~15 April 2009
    - `MRT_TABLE_DUMP` since 26 October 2001
    - `sh ip bgp` since 8 November 1997 --> straightenRV

0. Determine file locations to download (corresponding to once/week on Friday @ midnight?):
    - MRT: 
        - `http://archive.routeviews.org/bgpdata/YYYY.MM/RIBS/rib.YYYYMMDD.HHMM.bz2`
    
    - `sh ip bgp`:
        - `http://archive.routeviews.org/oix-route-views/YYYY.MM/oix-full-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.dat.bz2` until 31 December 1999
        - `http://archive.routeviews.org/oix-route-views/YYYY.MM/oix-full-snapshot-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.dat.bz2` after 1 January 2000

0. Identify a consistent peer across the data set
    - 3356? "The Carrier's Carrier"?
    - the provider with the most prefixes?
    - analyze the routing tables to figure this out?
        - a second form/purpose for calling the c program
        - check if it's V2 with Python first -- easily read the peer index table. if not, then crawl with C

1. generate individual routing table (C)
    - process data using c, taking args: [filename, peer_as]
    - output data from the given peer_as: prefix + as_path
    - addition for jesse's to insert (prefix, as_path, date) into postgres

2. postgres database schema

3. run elements into tree algorithm (C?)
    - output top aggregable ASes based on count
    - output aggregated routing table (for jesse)?
