Hello Stephen,


any thoughts on how to fix it?


back to the &quot;smallest allocation&quot; per /8 that the RIRs have published 
and make it part of the MoU at the larger NAPs/exchange points.

at the large end i'm still without an explanation as to why large 
networks require so many prefixes - none of them seem to comment?

Commercial reasons? The traffic goes to the 32x/24 instead of the /19. 
Not to mention the BGP customer may go to another provider. You end up 
in discussions (if you get that chance at all) with your sales group 
and look like a dogmatic fool as &quot;other companies do this&quot;.

Saving the world works best if the pain is no one's fault - at least 
&quot;not my fault&quot; ;-)


Regards, Marc
