&gt; 
&gt; This is not to pick on CERFNET but just to highlight a problem of
&gt; actually tracking the size of the routing table in general. This 
&gt; CERFnet case seems to be this way becuase it is a direct peer of
&gt; Bill's box even though I can see no reason why the more specifics are
&gt; needed.
&gt; 
&gt; Looking a little more it seems a large amount of more specifics are being
&gt; announced to Bill's boxe which aren't being announced to the xara.net
&gt; router. Perhaps ISPs are taking more care at places like MAE-East with
&gt; their outbound filters than they are at Bill's peering point even though
&gt; Bill only has 6 active EBGP neighbors and the xara.net router has 39
&gt; ;-(.


Apparently true. The specifics leak from one of our CIDR blocks
was only being made to Bill's peering point ( otherwise known
as MAE-LA or MELEE when first started ;-) ). Being fixed shortly. Thanks 

On the larger question, it would be difficult to find two places
on the net with a  consistent view of the global routing table 
although for trend analysis both MAE East and the Sprint NAP should have
a more of a representative view than MAE-LA.
