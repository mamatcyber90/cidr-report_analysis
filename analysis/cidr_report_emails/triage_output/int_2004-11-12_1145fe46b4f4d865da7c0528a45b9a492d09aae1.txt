&gt; &gt;&gt; e.g. is AS18566 the origin AS for 751 prefixes that could be
&gt; &gt;&gt; collapsed to 6?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; not to justify the expense, but perhaps covad is renumbering from one
&gt; &gt; block to another? Looking at their advertisments I see lots of /23 or /24
&gt; &gt; blocks inside their larger covering routes... So either they deaggregated
&gt; &gt; to renumber more gracefully, or they forgot their prefix-list outbound to
&gt; &gt; williams and exodus ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; perhaps covad can explain? or silently cover up the 'mistake' (which is
&gt; &gt; acceptable as well...)
&gt;
&gt; it's not just covad.  they're just such an egregious case among
&gt; many socially and technically irresponsible polluters.

eh, since I singled out covad: (and I feel bad for it now)
what about for COX? what about for UU (doh, thats me...or our tac or
something, I'll look/ask), what about Comcast? and TWTC? ArmStrong?

Of these listed 4 are cable companies, is there something in the cable
modem networking that requires deaggregated routes beyond their borders?
Is the problem that they might have seperate 'networks' for their regional
parts and leak more specifics for these parts along with 'backup' routes
via aggregates?
