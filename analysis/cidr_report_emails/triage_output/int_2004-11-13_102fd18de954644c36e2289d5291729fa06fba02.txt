&gt; Interestingly enough what Covad appears to be saying is:
&gt; 
&gt; If we had a way to announce two things
&gt; 
&gt; 1 - here are the advertisements for covering aggregates for Covad
&gt; 
&gt; AND
&gt; 
&gt; 2 - do not believe any more specifics for these address blocks, as they are 
&gt; NOT part of Covad's routing policy for these prefixes
&gt; 
&gt; then we would not be seeing this unfortunate case of unauthorized route 
&gt; leakage being resolved in a way that seems to have unfortunate bgp 
&gt; implications in terms of more specifics appearing.
&gt; 
&gt; So its an interesting question. How could Covad achieve a routing policy 
&gt; announcement of the form as stated in 2 above?

register the covering prefixes in the irr and folk should filter.
folk who don't filter are welcome to the results.  i encourage my
competitors not to filter.
