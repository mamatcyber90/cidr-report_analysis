even it breaking.


Knee? Shape? Curve? Are you reading the same CIDR report
that I see here every Friday? The report that I see is
basically a dump of raw data. Perhaps the author needs
to remember the distinction between data and information
and make the CIDR report into something that people
*WANT* to read. This posting of yours contained far more
information than any CIDR report.


The author is providing a service by giving us raw data.  If that is 
all they want to do, we cannot (and should not) force them to do more.  
Besides, I like raw data. :-)

Also, as for the &quot;knee&quot; Joe mentioned, I think he is talking about the 
fact the report went wonky.  Look at the data presented in the last 
CIDR report - it is nonsense, obviously in error.  This is not the 
&quot;shape&quot; of the &quot;curve&quot;, it is the data itself.
