What auto-summarisation?

If you're talking about the cisco &quot;auto-summary&quot; command, then the 
answer is &quot;so bad that it's universally disabled&quot; (but then 
&quot;auto-summary&quot; is concerned with aggregation on pre-CIDR, classful 
boundaries which I don't think is what you were talking about).

Absent a precise understanding of all the routing policies concerned, 
proxy aggregation is dangerous and is hence generally not done.
