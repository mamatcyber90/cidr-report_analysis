More on BGP table size and the number of fragmentary 
announcements in the Internet
http://www.tm.uka.de/idrws/2004/contributions2004/IDRWS2004--04--Huston_Geoff--Allocations_and_Advertisements.pdf
This is Geoff Huston's presentation at the Inter-Domain
Routing Workshop in May 2004. Slides for all the
other talks here http://www.tm.uka.de/idrws/2004/contributions2004/

I suggest that if people find this stuff useful, they 
might want to ask the authors to provide an update
at the next NANOG meeting.

As for Joe's lament about no new studies, I think
that after it was pointed out that BGP table growth
had halted http://www.netsys.com/library/papers/cengiz-bgp-2002-08.pdf
many people probably thought that the problem had
been solved forever by the telecom collapse.
