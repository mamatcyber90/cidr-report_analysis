The issue we see is 
bad aggregation - the root cause is bad practise and processes 
that manifest into bad aggregation. I would argue that 
networks with poor aggregation are also networks that will tend to 
have more routeing issues and other outages although I have no
data to back that claim up.

I think it depends on which part of the world you look in. But I've 
visited enough ISPs in the last 7 years in my part of the world (outside 
US and Western Europe) to know that this is an accurate statement. 
Again, no data to back this experience up.

&gt;&gt;Commercial reasons? The traffic goes to the 32x/24 instead of
&gt;&gt;the /19.
&gt;
&gt; If that's the reason why the table is growing so much then we
&gt; are all in deep deep trouble.

Quite often many service providers are de-aggregating without knowing 
it. They receive their /20 or whatever from the RIR, but they consider 
this to be 16 Class Cs - I'm not joking - and announce them as such to 
the Internet. I spend a lot of time getting these folks to announce 
aggregates, but it is hard work convincing people that this will even 
work. Even if the RIR recommends that they announce their address block, 
they still consider it as Class Cs - even Class Bs for some big 
allocations. :(

Solution is education, but the industry is such in many parts of the 
world that education is not desired but considered a negative reflection 
on people's abilities, whether they have the abilities or not. And the 
lack of educators - there are several of us on the worldwide NOG trail 
but it's very clear we are not enough. Nor do the NOGs cover the ISP 
industry, but just those who are interested in participating. We are not 
enough due to lack of time, lack of supportive employers, more focus on 
making profit in these leaner times, etc...

Where next I don't know...
