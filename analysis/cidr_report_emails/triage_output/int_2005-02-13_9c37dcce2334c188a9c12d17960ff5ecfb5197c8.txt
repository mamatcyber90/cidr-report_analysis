&gt; &gt; There are some business reasons to de-aggregate. Look at some outages

&gt; &gt; knows me as a /20)
&gt;
&gt; I am surprised you bring such an argument up. While we can
&gt; surely agree on this happening on the net, I have yet to
&gt; hear from someone saying this is happening more than once
&gt; a month or so. Maybe Todd from Renesys has other examples
&gt; besides the Yahoo incident.^

if it happens once to you and lasts long enough... I'm not condoning it,
nor saying it's even a valid reason to do it, just pointing out that it
does happen :(

&gt;
&gt; &gt; There are multiple reasons for deaggregation aside from 'dumb operator',
&gt; &gt; some are even 'valid' if you look at them from the protection standpoint.
&gt;
&gt; I won't argue that, but how many ISPs are using this line
&gt; of argument? I have not heard anyone yet telling me this,
&gt; not in years.
&gt;

a few have... recently in fact.
