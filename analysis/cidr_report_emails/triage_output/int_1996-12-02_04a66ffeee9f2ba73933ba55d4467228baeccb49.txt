&gt; Bill et al,
&gt; &gt; 	It may only be a trend as seen from the xara.net boxen.
&gt; 
&gt; is basically AGIS full table union Sprint full table union
&gt; UUnet full table union 
&gt; 
&gt; For reasons two complicated to go into I've got entirely
&gt; different full routing on a box in London, and yes, it's
&gt; a different size (smaller actually last time I looked).
&gt; 
&gt; Alex Bligh
&gt; Xara Networks

	Does this call into question the idea that there is a
	single &quot;default-free&quot; view of the Internet?

	My box is attempting to collect a view of the routing
	system as seen at a particular point in the topology.
	While this may not be interesting to Randy, others
	might find it useful.

	I would be interested in tracking the views as seen at
	a number of different places in the topology. The deltas
	between the growth in the number of widely dispersed routes
	vs the local varience would be an interesting number to 
	track.
