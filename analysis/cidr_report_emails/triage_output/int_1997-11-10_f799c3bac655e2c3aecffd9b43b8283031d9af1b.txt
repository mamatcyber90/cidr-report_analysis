Re: The Cidr Report
From: Tony Bates
Date: Mon Nov 10 11:53:04 1997


For those of you who look at the report you may have noticed it looked
a little odd for the last week. This is becuase my access to the router I use
to gather the information got cut off by mistake last (from Nov 3rd in
fact) week. It is now fixed. Check 

http://www.employees.org/~tbates/cidr-report.html 

if you'd like to see a daily snapshot otherwise it should be back up
and running normally this Friday. Aplogies.
