RE: The Cidr Report - web site inaccessible ?
From: Peter Murray

The employees.org server was attacked, and is being rebuilt.

----
Excerpts from willers.employees.org /etc/motd:

On Friday, June 28, 2002, willers.employees.org was hacked and the root
filesystem was compromised.  The system is still under re-construction.

[snip]

We will try to bring up http services over the next week.

Looks like some permissions have yet to be set correctly, as the webserver
is actually up and running.

&gt; Gregory,
&gt;
&gt; Yes, the website is down at the moment due to a failure on the server
- &gt; I'm told it will be back in the next few days... Sorry about this.
&gt; We'd no obvious way of telling everyone without spamming the whole
&gt; mailing list...
&gt;
&gt; (If it isn't back by the next report, I'll have to do that..)
&gt;
&gt; best wishes!
