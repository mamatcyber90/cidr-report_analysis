&gt; &gt;&gt;- this month, another knee was at 150k [Dec 4th] and similarly
&gt; &gt;&gt;  garbled results came out. Again, no response.
&gt; &gt;&gt;...in this one year we've seen the shape of the climb return to the
&gt; &gt;&gt;curve characterized by two years 99-01. Going for e?  I'm not quite
&gt; &gt;&gt;sure what the current point of the report is if no-one responds to
&gt; &gt;&gt;even it breaking.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Knee? Shape? Curve? Are you reading the same CIDR report
&gt; &gt;that I see here every Friday? The report that I see is
&gt; &gt;basically a dump of raw data. Perhaps the author needs
&gt; &gt;to remember the distinction between data and information
&gt; &gt;and make the CIDR report into something that people
&gt; &gt;*WANT* to read. This posting of yours contained far more
&gt; &gt;information than any CIDR report.

&gt; 
&gt; Also, as for the &quot;knee&quot; Joe mentioned, I think he is talking about the 
&gt; fact the report went wonky.  Look at the data presented in the last 
&gt; CIDR report - it is nonsense, obviously in error.  This is not the 
&gt; &quot;shape&quot; of the &quot;curve&quot;, it is the data itself.

Correct on 'knee' but for crying out loud, follow the pointy clicky
references to the website. Of course there isn't going to be a curve 
in email [you want ascii plots? how 1980s], but the email quite 
clearly points you the way to the site where there is some analysis 
of the raw data.  

For many of us, the mail is a reminder 'here's the current raw info, 
check the detailed stuff over here'.  There is no secret cabal or
hidden ionfo, the report email

Joe, finding it a sad state of affairs that he must cut and paste
&quot;http://www.cidr-report.org/cgi-bin/plota?file=%2fvar%2fdata%2fbgp%2fas4637%2fbgp%2dactive%2etxt&amp;descr=Active%20BGP%20entries%20%28FIB%29&amp;ylabel=Active%20BGP%20entries%20%28FIB%29&amp;with=step&quot; into this message for people to 
   actually look at the graph. 

PS &quot;2001 bellovin bush griffin rexford&quot; entered into google hits the
 specific reference quite nicely - sorry i didn't include the title. 
  as michael pointed out the specific links migrate all the time, so 
  i was purposefully avoiding 'where it can be found at this moment'
