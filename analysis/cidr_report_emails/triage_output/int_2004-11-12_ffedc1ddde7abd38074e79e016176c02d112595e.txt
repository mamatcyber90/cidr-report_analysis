&gt; &gt; are these numbers what i think, but hope not, they are?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; e.g. is AS18566 the origin AS for 751 prefixes that could be
&gt; &gt; collapsed to 6?
&gt; 
&gt; 	Sort of - from here it looks like they aren't actually announcing
&gt; the supernets.

So you don't see:
64.105.0.0/16
66.134.0.0/16
66.166.0.0/15
67.100.0.0/14
68.164.0.0/14
69.3.0.0/16

?

&gt; I don't see their stuff listed in the radb,

They actually did register all that more-specific crap (determined by
checking some 10 samples), so they do this fully intentional.

Well, it boils down that if you have enough customers, you seem to
get away with about any antisocial behaviour on the net.

&gt; Plus the public hand slap is kind of amusing. But that's probably
&gt; just me.

The problem is that they probably couldn't care less. There is no
public sanctioning and pressure.

Daniel
