&gt; I tend to agree, the numbers I threw around earleir were strictly
&gt; first-order approximations for raw sizes. Second-order would include
&gt; performance issues and algorithm requirements. I see that Vadim ihas
&gt; already arrived there.

OK.. I meant the ability to *store* 100M table entries.  Flapping is
another story, which just aggrivates the cost problem ;)

&gt; Why $2M? From price ranges in the current market, I would think that
&gt; they'd have to hit under $200K. Actually, I would have a difficult time
&gt; convincing clients of anything over an additional $60K. This gets back
&gt; to my earlier question, how many backbone routers are there (nearest
&gt; order of magnitude should suffice here)?

Exactly.  We can all *SAY* we want features X, Y, and Z, but who will
actually *buy* them if they cost more?

I tossed out $2M as a straw man - it just seemed like a good &quot;you could build
almost anything for under that price, but nobody would buy&quot;.  If the added
cost is $50K per box, that increases the number of boxes you can sell, but..

The curve for price versus number sold is probably a hyperbolic (even
if my old economics texts drew it as a straight line ;) , whose exact
shape will depend *very* heavily on just how much price elasticity
there is.  And most organizations being what they are, it probably
will be pretty flabby until we get to the &quot;You need this level of
router or you're screwed&quot; state of affairs, at which point there will
be a mad rush to buy them. ;)

&gt; Typical rough market guidelines are that development cost must be less
&gt; than 1% of total market size or the project is a non-starter,
&gt; business-wise. Typical costs for this sort of project are $1M to $3M,
&gt; over 8 months, with COGm at about $50 (relative to a minimum Number of
&gt; Goods sold [NOGs] and assuming that it is technically feasible).

Hmm. 1%?  Based on what I've seen for cost estimates for other high-ticket
low-volume stuff (mostly mainframe-class computers, etc) I would have guessed
10%.  In any case, I think the point is made that we can talk all we want
about how we want &lt;insert router vendor name here&gt; to provide a truly high-end
router that solves everything, but the reality of the cost pressure does
need to be considered....
