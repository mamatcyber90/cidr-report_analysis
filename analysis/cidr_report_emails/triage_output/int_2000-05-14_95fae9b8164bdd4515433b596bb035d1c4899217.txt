Multi-home I (was CIDR Report)
From: Rural CNE
Date: Sun May 14 00:07:20 2000



If I understand the thread correctly, part of the growth
problem in the routing tables has been attributed to
small clients with sub/24 address allocations implementing
multi-homed solutions.

As an Internet Access Provider (IAP), I thought I'd share a few opinions...

+ ip allocation +
Address allocation is not very pretty when you start to
move down from the tier 1's.  Upstream providers tend to
grab the &quot;next available&quot; /22, /23, or /24, which is usually
located about a thousand miles away from your current
allocation.

(Well, you should have planned for growth...)
Agreed, but ARIN and most upstreams do not accept
&quot;I think I'm gonna quadruple my customer base next year&quot;
as a viable excuse.  And for good reason, given the allocation
abuses that have occured in the past.

So now we have these IAP's with multiple /24's scattered haphazardly
across the upstream provider's delegated block.

Now what happens when this IAP multi-homes?

(There are very few valid reasons to multi-home, please consult
with RFC x, BCP y, and an experienced network engineer.)
Roger that.
