&gt; &gt; [...]   - would you agree that most of the poor deaggregating is not intentional
&gt; &gt; ie that they're announcing their '16 class Cs' or historically had 2 /21s and
&gt;
&gt; Think about someone putting in a Null0 route and re-
&gt; exporting stuff unconditionally, now after he originates
&gt; his /19 he is then adding a /24 here, and a /25 there.
&gt; Lack of experience, when you suggest to them they should
&gt; remove these announcements they are afraid to change it,
&gt; not understanding the implications, etc.
&gt;
&gt; Not to mention ppl using cisco and prefix lists, it is
&gt; way too easy with cisco to say '/19 le 24', and then they
&gt; use outbound prefix lists to their transit supplier
&gt; (different, but related as I see it). Some transit ISPs
&gt; use that a lot, and encourage the table growth.

There are some business reasons to de-aggregate. Look at some outages
caused by 'routing problems' (someone leaked my /24's to their peers,
peers, peer and my traffic got blackholed, because the public net only
knows me as a /20)

There are multiple reasons for deaggregation aside from 'dumb operator',
some are even 'valid' if you look at them from the protection standpoint.
