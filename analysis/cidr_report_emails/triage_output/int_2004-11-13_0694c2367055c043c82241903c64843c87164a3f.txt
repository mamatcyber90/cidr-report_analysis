are these numbers what i think, but hope not, they are?

e.g. is AS18566 the origin AS for 751 prefixes that could be
collapsed to 6?


Barry and me tried:

Covad was first contacted Aug 2002:

AS18566  264     4         260      98.5%    COVAD Covad Communications


But Covad was just one.  I used to quietly contact these &quot;pollutors&quot; along 
with a few others who helped out (Barry and Terry) but as of a year ago I'm 
giving my 5-10 hours of volunteerism per month to nsp-sec.

if not, then perhaps the report could use some work.

if so, then
  o why are providers indulging is such extremely sick
    behavior
  o and who can hack the perl to generate filters for this
    so we can listen only to the aggregates
