According to my archives, the last CIDR report was badly broken:

        03-11-06    199409      129843

After someone noticed we got this:

There were no more CIDR reports following that, perhaps he never got  
around to fixing it?

According to my kept messages of Nanog List, they were coming every  
7 days. I have them back from 6/2/2006 up to 11/3/2006. Maybe they  
had a script or job quit on them that emailed the thing.

Yes, I know that I can go to the site for the report, but it just  
suddenly vanished (at least to me), without warning. Was I the  
only one still reading it from the mailing list? Was there an  
announcement, and I just missed it?

Please see http://www.cidr-report.org for the full report

Private replies okay, but I bet I'm not the only one for whom it  
just suddenly vanished. I like my stuff in plain text when I can  
get it; the web site is nice, but I'm not point and clicky type.
