So anyway, was discussing the cidr report at the last nanog.. I was pointing out 
that deaggregation is discouraged by the naming and shaming and then someone 
else pointed out that this list has scarcely altered in months.

So, what can we do as the operator community if this report isnt having the 
desired effect? 

Stop accepting /24 type routes?
