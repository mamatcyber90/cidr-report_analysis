&gt; over 2500 routes could be removed from the routing table

or make room for 2500 of those long prefixes nobody wants
to accept

&gt; this is pretty embarrassing for the operator community.

Only when size of table is used as an excuse to not let longer
prefixes be used, instead causing more address space to be used
to get by those filters.
