Hi Stephen,

that applies to medium and large providers
too reading this list - how often do they actually check what prefixes they are 
sourcing, from my recent work at a couple of european IXes i had a number of 
folks email me offlist as they hadnt realised til I sent out an email they had 
deaggregation and once it was pointed out they just fixed it.

I don't think many people have the time to check customers deaggregation 
- it doesn't obviously help with their company's business/profits 
therefore isn't on the radar. Or is a job done when they have time. Like 
you, Hank and I (amongst many others) have spent quite a bit of time 
pointing out possible leakages to providers - and most have been very 
polite and appreciative of the advice. I've had a few negative 
reactions, mostly questioning why this is any of my business. :(

so to repeat my earlier suggestion - if transit providers, particularly the 
larger ones setup scripts to notify their customers daily/weeks of routing 
deaggregation do you think we might gain some traction in educating and fixing 
this?

Interesting thought - yes that might help, but then how many providers 
would be willing to do this? The CIDR report website is available, 
anyone can pop their ASN into the tool there, and they can figure out 
what needs to be aggregated. Should the tool be packaged up as something 
anyone can run from their web page, or a cron job? What would customers 
think about this if their upstreams do it? Or should some third party do 
it, like Geoff and I post our respective regional reports and 
aggregation summaries...? How would this differ from spam - and anyway, 
how would be get in touch with every ISP on the Internet... etc...
