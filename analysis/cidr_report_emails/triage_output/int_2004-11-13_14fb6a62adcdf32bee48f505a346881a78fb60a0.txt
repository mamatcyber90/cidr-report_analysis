&gt; Of these listed 4 are cable companies, is there something in the cable

No, for the general statement about 'cable modem networking'.

&gt; Is the problem that they might have seperate 'networks' for their regional
&gt; parts and leak more specifics for these parts along with 'backup' routes
&gt; via aggregates?

This is trivial to do only as far as your $s carry. Aggregate draws 
the traffic, then NO_EXPORT-tagged longest-match carries the 
regionalized traffic.  Folks do this as a 'best exit' approach between 
peer netwworks all the time.  If you are suggesting disjoint, unconnected 
islands, then they should be separate ASNs for sane paths; see charter's
islands, the pre-271 refleif ILEC LATA-bound islands, etc.
