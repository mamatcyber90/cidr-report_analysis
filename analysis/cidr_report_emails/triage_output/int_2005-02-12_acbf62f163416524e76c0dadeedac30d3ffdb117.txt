Hi Philip,

&gt; Quite often many service providers are de-aggregating without knowing it. They

&gt; a lot of time getting these folks to announce aggregates, but it is hard work
&gt; convincing people that this will even work. Even if the RIR recommends that
&gt; they announce their address block, they still consider it as Class Cs - even
&gt; Class Bs for some big allocations. :(

this is getting into what i was implying earlier.. you have wider experience 
than me - would you agree that most of the poor deaggregating is not intentional 
ie that they're announcing their '16 class Cs' or historically had 2 /21s and 
dont even realise they could fix it.. that applies to medium and large providers 
too reading this list - how often do they actually check what prefixes they are 
sourcing, from my recent work at a couple of european IXes i had a number of 
folks email me offlist as they hadnt realised til I sent out an email they had 
deaggregation and once it was pointed out they just fixed it.

so to repeat my earlier suggestion - if transit providers, particularly the 
larger ones setup scripts to notify their customers daily/weeks of routing 
deaggregation do you think we might gain some traction in educating and fixing 
this?
