&gt; ~ +3000 routes in one week? Anyone else frightened by this?

Only people who have stock in vendors welcome it. Be prepared
for another huge glut of unnecessary outages, hardware and 
memory upgrades soon folks! 

FYI - at $job [AS8220] we have just completed a program
to fix the aggregation problem that we had. It took
about 10 weeks to complete and I will present a paper
on this at LINX 48 next week. 

Regards,
Neil.
