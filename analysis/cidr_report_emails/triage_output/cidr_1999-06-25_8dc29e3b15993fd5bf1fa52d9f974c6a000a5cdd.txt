It is not checked before it leaves my workstation.  However, hopefully 
you will find this report interesting and will take the time to look 
through this to see if you can improve the amount of aggregation you 
perform.

The report is split into sections:

   0) General Status
   
      List the route table history for the last week, list any possibly
      bogus routes seen and give some status on ASes.

   1) Gains by aggregating at the origin AS level

      This lists the &quot;Top 30&quot; players who if they decided to aggregate
      their announced classful prefixes at the origin AS level could 
      make a significant difference in the reduction of the current 
      size of the Internet routing table. This calculation does not 
      take into account the inclusion of holes when forming an aggregate
      so it is possible even larger reduction should be possible.

   2) Weekly Delta

      A summary of the last weeks changes in terms of withdrawn and
      added routes. Please note that this is only a snapshot but does 
      give some indication of ASes participating in CIDR. Clearly,
      it is generally a good thing to see a large amont of withdrawls.

   3) Interesting aggregates

      Interesting here means not an aggregate made as a set of 
      classful routes.      

Thanks to xara.net for giving me access to their routing tables once a
day. 

Please send any comments about this report directly to me.
