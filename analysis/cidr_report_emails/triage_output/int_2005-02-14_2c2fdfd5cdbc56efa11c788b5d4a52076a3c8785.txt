Well said.  At NANOG you get the clueful people cuz they at least knew to 
come.  That is a start.  But there are hundreds of ISPs out there who don't 
have a clue.  RIPE realized this without having to do a membership poll and 
rightly so, goes and does training where it is needed (and believe me - I 
am their biggest critic and all-around pain in the ass when it comes to 
their expenses as Leo and Rob can attest).

NANOG is not the place to do it.  ARIN, as part of their overhead should do 
an east coast, west coast and Chicago area tutorial at least once a 
year.  And guess what - most of the training material has already been 
written by the other RIRs.

The BGP tutorials I've been doing on Sundays at NANOG all cover 
aggregation - at least, I seem to end up talking about aggregation in each 
one. Maybe I need to be more direct? But then again, who am I preaching 
to? The choir maybe, I don't know. Maybe we need a specific aggregation 
tutorial for those who don't know how to? Those who have operational and 
technical reasons not to aggregate have made that decision with prior 
knowledge. We should try and give everyone else the knowledge, then at 
least we will know that all de-aggregation is done for a reason.

Then it begs the question, is NANOG the conference actually reaching the 
people who'd most benefit from it? I say this as I'm in transit in 
Singapore heading back from a hugely successful and enjoyable SANOG (South 
Asia NOG) in Bangladesh. Similar idea to NANOG, but heavier emphasis on 
education (workshops &amp; tutorials), and we had ISPs falling over themselves 
to participate in the first Internet operations meeting held in that country.
