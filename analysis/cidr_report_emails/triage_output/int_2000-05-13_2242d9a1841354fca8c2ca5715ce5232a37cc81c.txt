&gt; But if you look at the last 250 days or so you see that the table has

&gt; perhaps exponential, instead of the nice linear growth since CIDR was
&gt; introduced.  

This might be due to the fact that more companies are buying backup
connections and announcing maybe only a /24 or /23. Of course, Verio will
filter them saying it is good for the net. Tho they forget that they send out
what they claim to filter. Seems they might have another motive for
filtering...

&gt; To the $64,000^h^h^h^h^h^h $10,000,000 (you gotta change with the times
&gt; :-) questions are why?  anyone care to guess when it starts to become a
&gt; problem and with what widely deployed boxes first? is there anything we
&gt; can do about it?

Our routers carry 1.1 million paths + in their tables today. I have seen
higher numbers (that was the first router I logged into). Current GSRs and
Juunipers in the core should have no problems with 100,000 routes.
