Changes since version 0.4
-------------------------

  straightenRV:

    Added support for parsing MRT format RIBs (with the aid of the command
    line tool 'bgpdump').

    Fixed parsing of AS sets using spaces as separators instead of commas.

Changes since version 0.3
-------------------------

  straightenRV:
                                                                                
    Added the .stats file and moved statistics from .log to .stats.
    A count of the number of input lines skipped is written to .stats.
                                                                                
    Most output messages emitted during input processing are logged to .log
    rather than STDERR.
    Output messages have been made more consistent.
                                                                                
    Lines containing AS path loops starting at the first AS in the path are no
    longer skipped (unless the new -s option is passed).
                                                                                
Changes since version 0.2
-------------------------

  Added support for bzip2-compressed and uncompressed RouteViews tables.

Changes since version 0.1
-------------------------

  Added '-m' option to straightenRV for lower memory usage.

  straightenRV is now able to handle lines in the snapshot that are split due
  to an overrunning 'Network' (prefix) field.
