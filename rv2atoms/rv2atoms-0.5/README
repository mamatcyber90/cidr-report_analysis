This package contains a number of perl scripts which analyze and process a
RouteViews table and compute BGP policy atoms.

The scripts assume perl is /usr/bin/perl. If perl is in a different location,
you should either change the '#!' line at the top of each script, or invoke
a script as follows:
	$ /usr/local/bin/perl script
Or if you like to turn on warnings:
	$ /usr/local/bin/perl -w script

Here is an example of usage:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Fetch RouteViews table.
wget http://archive.routeviews.org/oix-route-views/2002.12/oix-full-snapshot-2002-12-01-1200.dat.bz2

# First run of straightenRV.
straightenRV oix-full-snapshot-2002-12-01-1200.dat.bz2

# Second run of straightenRV.
# Only RouteViews peers are used that carry at least 115000 prefixes (of length
# /24 or less).
straightenRV -c 115000:bgp20021201f.peer oix-full-snapshot-2002-12-01-1200.dat.bz2

# Compute the atoms.
# '-T .' ensures that temporary files (potentially very large) are placed in
# the current directory.
findBgpAtoms -T . bgp20021201p36 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The output files generated are described in detail in the man pages.

Note that straightenRV may consume a lot of memory: around 600000 Kbytes on a
FreeBSD 4.2 system while analysing a RouteViews snapshot of February 2003.
Pass '-m all' to straightenRV to reduce memory usage to around 180000 Kbytes
(for the aforementioned case), at the expense of some data not being generated.

Please consult the man pages of straightenRV(1) and findBgpAtoms(1) (included
in this package) or our web page at http://www.caida.org/projects/routing/atoms/
for further information.
